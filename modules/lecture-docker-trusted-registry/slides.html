						<ul>
							<li>Centrally located base images</li>
							<li>Store individual build images</li>
							<li>Pull tested images to production</li>
							<li>Developer workflow is a commit</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">Speaker Notes:
						The first is CI/CD. Many customers start here. This use case is focused on:
						<li>Stored base images that can be reused as a base layer</li>
						<li>Stored layers from which you can start a build</li>
						<li>Stored images after they are built and tested in CI</li>
						<li>A library of images that can be deployed by production</li>
						<li>Developers don’t know they are using docker (they just commit code through GH or SCCM of choice).</li>

						<ul>
							<li>With Docker UCP</li>
							<li>Deploy Jenkins executors or Hadoop nodes</li>
							<li>Instant-on developer environment</li>
							<li>Select curated apps from a catalog</li>
						</ul>
                        <aside class="notes">Speaker Notes:
						The second use case is to deliver containers as a service. Think of this as a curated application catalog (like App Store) that teams can set up and allow individuals to deploy a ready-to-use container. Examples include jenkins executors and hadoop nodes. This is a classic use case for Docker Hub today and our intention is to make the two products look identical from a functional standpoint.
